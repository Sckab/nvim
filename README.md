# NVIM CONFIG

This is my personal nvim config, it uses the leggendary one dark pro theme.
It has auto completition, auto-formatting, and a bunch of other cool things!

Those are the language supported:

- Lua
- Astro
- Html
- Css
- Javascript
- Typescript
- Bash
- C#
- Toml
- Json
- Xml
- Yaml
- Markdown
- Python
- Go
